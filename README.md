# Dynamic-Stereo-Camera-Calibration

For 3D measurements and several other applications monocular and multi-camera calibration is an essential step. Both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters needs to be calculated for this. Typical solution is by using calibration patterns. But there are situations where the camera parameters can change following the initial calibration or situations where using such patterns is not feasible. Dynamic/self-calibration is the solution for such cases, wherein images of the 3D world are captured and using multiple such images and feature matching, the calibration is done. This project explores a solution for monocular and stereo camera calibration using multiple images captured in a given scene. It is assumed that the intrinsic parameters are known.
